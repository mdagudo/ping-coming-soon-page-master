### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Submit their email address using an `input` field
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
	- The `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say *"Whoops! It looks like you forgot to add your email"*
	- The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say *"Please provide a valid email address"*

## My process

This is my first challenge using Bootstrap! I have to admit I'm not a big fan, that "grid" system just reminds me of when they used flex as grid containers and I prefer real grid now, but it is really useful for certain things, like making the columns responsive. 

The design process was really simple and quick, but I got stucked in the JS. I'm not so good at Javascript, I did a very basic online course and this is the first time I'm practicing, so I hope I get better with every challenge.  

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) 

### What I learned

I learned Bootstrap and a very simple email validation using Javascript. 

### Continued development

I have to keep practicing Bootstrap and keep learning Javascript.

### Useful resources

- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com) - I always use this for documentation!
- [Bootstrap Documentation](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/getting-started/introduction/) - This documentation is so understandable! I found something about email validation I've been looking for weeks, and that helped me finally get to understand form validation with JS, although I didn't used Bootstrap's validation.
- [W3resource](https://www.w3resource.com/javascript/form/email-validation.php) - I used the regEx expression given in this page for the valid email address.
